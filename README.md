* 1.You are given a 2D matrix. Find the row-wise maximum sum, which is let's say, rowMax. And then, find the column-wise maximum sum, which is let's say, colMax. Now, print the minimum between rowMax and colMax

* 2. You are given a string S. You need to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example if the string is “aabccaaa” the output should be “a2b1c2a3”.
You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters
